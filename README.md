# FED3 Time Bins üêÅ

### Overview

__FED3__

FED3 or Feeding Experimentation Device Version 3 is a [home cage feeding device](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3), developed by the [Kravitz Lab](https://kravitzlab.com/). <br>
It is open source and is used for the training of mice in operant tasks. <br>

__Purpose__

The CSV output from the FED3 devices show the timestamps of each event, like nose pokes or pellet retrievals. This repository :
* Converts this output into a time binned file. It also adds another sheet with the time stamps of all pellet count changes.
* Creates a master file that combines all the ‚ÄúLeft poke count‚Äù columns from the raw FED files into one sheet. It does the same thing for the other column types as well. The columns are then sorted by genotype and treatment. <br>
